\title{Prelimitary Analysis of the Relationship Between Conlifct Measures and Nightlights in Thailand}

\section*{Introduction \& Background}

\textbf{Research Question:} Is there a relationship between conflict measure and nightlights in Thailand? How did this relationship change during the decade 2010-2020?

To answer this research question, two types of data are required: the conflict data and the nightlight data. Conflict data can be obtained from \textcite{davies_organized_2025}'s UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED), which contains disaggregated conflict data on conflict events for specific times and locations. To ensure data completeness, we will not select based on event location precision and conflict type at this stage. However, further arguments and concerns may be necessary in a later analysis.

Nightlights data is widely publicly available \footnote{e.g., \href{https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/wb-light-every-night-readme.html}{World Bank Light Every Night Data}, \textcite{Li2020}}. The two main sources of night lights data are the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP), available until 2013, and the Day-Night Band (DNB) of the VIIRS onboard the Suomi satellite launched by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2011. The VIIRS data is more advanced, contains fewer errors, and is more suitable for research. To adjust for inconsistencies between the two datasets, \textcite{Li2020} integrated DMSP data with VIIRS data, making the night-light raster data consistent from 1992 to 2020. As the research question focuses on the recent decade, which includes a transition period in nightlight data technology and methodology, we use \textcite{Li2020} adjusted nightlight data for time-series comparison and analysis. It is also worth noting that \textcite{gibson_night_2020} discuss the potential risks of applying such data to economic analysis based on their underlying data collection methodology.

\section{Asian Map}
Figure \ref{fig:asianmap} shows conflict measures and night-lights for countries in Asia, where Figure \ref{fig:asian2020} shows the measures for the year 2020 and Figure \ref{fig:asian2010} shows the measures for the year 2010. The maps on the left show only nightlights, while the maps on the right show conflict events (red dots) in each country, overlaid on the nightlights data.

By comparing the areas of conflict and nightlight intensity, it is possible to identify a negative relationship between nightlight usage and the concentration of conflict events. This negative correlation also exists consistently over time: in 2010, for example, nightlight intensity was lower and conflict intensity was higher than in 2020.

\section{Thailand Map}
The comparison maps specifically of Thailand for year 2010 and 2020 are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:thailandmap}, where Figure \ref{fig:thailand2020} shows the nightlights and conflict events happened in Thailand in 2020 and Figure \ref{fig:thailand2010} shows similar data in 2010. The red dots on the right of each figure indicate the number of conflicts that have been undergone in that year. The white lines on the map are the province borders, which are obtained from \href{https://gadm.org/download_country.html#google_vignette}{GADM}. 

The conflicts are concentrated in the southern provinces, whereas night-time light usage is concentrated around the capital. The map indicates similar correlations between conflict events and nightlights as in Figure \ref{fig:asianmap}. Conflicts are concentrated in areas with low night-time light usage. In 2010, there were fewer night-time lights and more conflicts than in 2020.

\section{Descriptive Statistics}
Next, Table \ref{tab:descrptive} represents the descriptive statistics of Thailand province-year panel data on the nightlight and conflict measure. There are 77 first-level provinces in Thailand, and the sample covers the period from 2010 to 2020. The variable \textit{nightlight mean} represents the average nightlight value in the given province in a particular year. \textit{Conflicts number} is the number of identified conflicts ongoing in a certain time and area, and \textit{conflicts events} is the total number of conflicts events occur in the province at a given year (the data unit of UCDP GED). A maximum of two types of conflict can occur in one province in one year, but 73 conflict events can occur in one province in a given year.

\section{Discussion}
In conclusion, the preliminary analysis suggests promising avenues for future research into the relationship between night lights and conflicts. However, to establish a causal relationship, other factors affecting both nightlights and conflicts need to be taken into consideration, such as government repression actions (both online and offline), rural/urban areas and GDP in each province etc. There may also be a time effect, given that some conflicts last for several years. Therefore, more robust research methodologies need to be employed for casual reference studies, such as difference-in-difference analysis.

\section{Declaration of AI}
I use AI tools and internet sources, such as books and YouTube videos, to enhance my understanding of geographical information systems and respective coding implementation in R during this task.
